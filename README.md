# **Purpose**

The purpose of this project was to build a react app that is built around the NYT article search api. 

# **Basic Functionality**

This application is pretty straight forward, the user searches for articles from The New York Times specifying the topic, and date range in years. The user has an option to save the article, and to comment on the saved articles.

The user also has a choice to remove their saved articles, or a singular comment from an article.
